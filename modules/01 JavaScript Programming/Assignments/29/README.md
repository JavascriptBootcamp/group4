<p>Create the constructor function for a Video object.</p>

<p>The function should take in arguments of <code>title (a string)</code>, <code>uploader (a string, the person who uploaded it)</code>, and <code>seconds (a number, the duration)</code>, and it should save them as properties of the object.</p>

<p>Create a method on the Video object called <code>watch()</code>. When that method is called, it should use console.log to output a string like "You watched all 60 seconds of Otters Holding Hands!"</p>

<p>Instantiate a new Video object and call the <code>watch()</code> method on it.</p>

<p>Instantiate another <code>Video</code> object with different constructor arguments.</p>

<p>Bonus: Use an array of data and a for loop to instantiate 5 <code>Video</code> objects.</p>

<p>Bonus: Make the watch method accept amounts of seconds to watch for, and call it with different amounts of seconds.</p>

<p>Use try-catch in order to catch errors. If an error occured log the following message: "Oops... An error occured"</p>
