        These are workers who "teach our kids in schools, and put out the fires in our houses and keep us alive in the hospital,"
        said Microsoft President Brad Smith in the report. The $500 million fund will be used to help create "tens of thousands
        of units" and will be split three ways: a $225 million loan at below-market interest rates will go to developers,
        $250 million will go toward market-rate loans for affordable housing construction while the remaining $25 million
        will be donated to services for low-income and the homeless.These are workers who "teach our kids in schools, and

        In the report Smith also added that Microsoft's funds alone aren't close to solving the housing problems, and is urging mayors
        in the Eastside cities to address policy barriers that are hindering affordable housing development. CNET has reached
        out to Microsoft for a comment, who referred us to its blog post on the matter.In the report Smith also added that

        was thrilled with the generous $4,000 bid I'd received on eBay last year for a saxophone I needed to sell. But that too-good-to-be-real

        name) asked for my email address so he could pay me on PayPal. I gave it to him. Minutes later, I received two emails
        that appeared to come from eBay and PayPal telling me to ship my saxophone within 24 hours to receive payment. In
        effect, they were telling me to complete the sale outside of eBay.was thrilled with the generous $4,000 bid I'd received
