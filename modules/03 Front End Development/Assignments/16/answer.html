        <h2>paragraph 1:</h2><br/>I was still working on the manuscript in January and February of this year. If you had tapped
        me on the shoulder in the middle of my frantic final edits and told me the book would become a bestseller before
        the year ended, I almost certainly would have cried with relief. As 2018 draws to a close, Atomic Habits has been
        out for 11 weeks (published on October 16, 2018). I did every single thing I could to make this book a success (starting
        with spending 3 years writing the best book possible), but the reception has outpaced even my high hopes. Highlights
        include: New York Times bestseller (#3 in Business and #5 in Advice/How-To) Wall Street Journal bestseller USA Today
        bestseller Audible bestseller Top 10 Most Sold on Amazon 4.9/5 stars on Amazon (350+ reviews) 4.8/5 stars on Audible

        Finalist for “Best Nonfiction Book of the Year” on Goodreads I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say “Thank
        You.” It means so much to me that you are finding the book useful and sharing it with others, and that my work is
        making some small difference in the world. If you're interested in buying a copy, click here to see the different
        options. Reach and Impact. It's hard to quantify, but I feel like my work is making a bigger impact this year than
        in previous years. Maybe it's just the excitement of seeing people read the book. Regardless, I have said from Day
        1 that I want to optimize for reach over revenue. I don't care about making the most money. I just want to share
        the best ideas I can find with the greatest number of people. And this year we reached more people than ever before.
        Here's what the year looked like: 9 new articles published this year (browse my best articles) 241,827 new email
        subscribers this year 453,037 total email subscribers as of December 31, 2018 10,600,219 unique visitors this year
        36,558,938 unique visitors since launching on November 12, 2012 Despite the success, there are some downsides hidden
        within these numbers. I'll discuss them in the next section. Travel. After not visiting a new country in 2017, I
        decided I would make travel a priority in 2018. And holy moly, did I travel this year. My travel highlights for 2018
        include: 7 countries (5 new): Argentina, Brazil, Chile, England, France, Japan, United States. 15 states (2 new):
        Arizona, California (4x), Florida (3x), Illinois (2x), Kansas, Massachusetts (2x), Nebraska, Nevada, New York (5x!),
        North Carolina (2x), Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington (2x). I continue to follow many of the strategies mentioned
        in my Ultralight Travel Guide, but I've also begun to implement some new approaches to accommodate for the number
        of speaking engagements I have do while traveling. I'll update that page soon. Rising to fame in the 1950s, she was
        one of the greatest actresses of her era. In 1953, Hepburn became the first actress to win an Academy Award, a Golden
        Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single performance: her leading role in the romantic comedy Roman Holiday. Even
        today, over half a century later, she remains one of just 15 people to earn an “EGOT” by winning all four major entertainment
        awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. By the 1960s, she was averaging more than one new film per year and, by everyone's
        estimation, she was on a trajectory to be a movie star for decades to come. But then something funny happened: she
        stopped acting. Despite being in her 30s and at the height of her popularity, Hepburn basically stopped appearing
        in films after 1967. She would perform in television shows or movies just five times during the rest of her life.
        Instead, she switched careers. She spent the next 25 years working tirelessly for UNICEF, the arm of the United Nations
        that provides food and healthcare to children in war-torn countries. She performed volunteer work throughout Africa,
        South America, and Asia. Hepburn's first act was on stage. Her next act was one of service. In December 1992, she
        was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her efforts, which is the highest civilian award of the United
        States. We will return to her story in a moment. This piece of code asks the username, and once the text is entered
        and the user presses enter, we send a greeting. The question() method shows the first parameter (a question) and
        waits for the user input. It calls the callback function once enter is pressed. In this callback function, we close
        the readline interface. readline offers several other methods, and I’ll let you check them out on the package documentation
        I linked above. If you need to require a password, it’s best to now echo it back, but instead showing a * symbol.
        The simplest way is to use the readline-sync package which is very similar in terms of the API and handles this out
        of the box. A more complete and abstract solution is provided by the Inquirer.js package. You can install it using
        npm install inquirer, and then you can replicate the above code like this: The labels “good habit” and “bad habit”
        are slightly inaccurate. There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective
        at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. When completing
        your Habits Scorecard, however, you can categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run. Generally
        speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette
        may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior. If you’re still
        having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior
        help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?”
        Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are
        typically bad. Where to Go From Here As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything at
        first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on. Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment
        or internal criticism. Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for your successes. If you eat
        a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it, almost as if you were watching someone else. Oh, how interesting that
        they would do such a thing. If you binge-eat, simply notice that you are eating more calories than you should. If
        you waste time online, notice that you are spending your life in a way that you do not want to. The process of behavior
        change always starts with awareness. Strategies like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are focused on
        getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them, which makes it easier to discover
        which habits you should change and respond in a way that benefits you.</p>

        <h2>paragraph 2:</h2><br/>The Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the world. If you ever find yourself
        riding a train in Tokyo, you’ll notice that the conductors have a peculiar habit. As each operator runs the train,
        they proceed through a ritual of pointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the train approaches
        a signal, the operator will point at it and say, “Signal is green.” As the train pulls into and out of each station,
        the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it’s time to leave, the operator will
        point at the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions. Before
        each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail
        is identified, pointed at, and named aloud. This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed
        to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85
        percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that
        is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.”
        Pointing-and-Calling Your Habits Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from
        a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and
        ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong. My wife does something similar. Whenever
        we are preparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her packing
        list. “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got my husband.” The more automatic a behavior
        becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand times before,
        we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will be just like the last. We’re so used to doing what
        we’ve always done that we don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do at all. Many of our failures
        in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness. One of our greatest challenges in changing habits
        is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can
        sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard,
        which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. There are no good habits or bad habits.
        There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the
        bad ones—which is why you repeat them. When completing your Habits Scorecard, however, you can categorize your habits
        by how they will benefit you in the long run. Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad

        may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior. If you’re still
        having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior
        help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?”
        Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are
        typically bad. Where to Go From Here As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything at
        first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on. Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment
        or internal criticism. Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for your successes. If you eat
        a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it, almost as if you were watching someone else. Oh, how interesting that
        they would do such a thing. If you binge-eat, simply notice that you are eating more calories than you should. If
        you waste time online, notice that you are spending your life in a way that you do not want to. The process of behavior
        change always starts with awareness. Strategies like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are focused on
        getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them, which makes it easier to discover
        which habits you should change and respond in a way that benefits you. The 4th. I was still working on the manuscript
        in January and February of this year. If you had tapped me on the shoulder in the middle of my frantic final edits
        and told me the book would become a bestseller before the year ended, I almost certainly would have cried with relief.
        As 2018 draws to a close, Atomic Habits has been out for 11 weeks (published on October 16, 2018). I did every single
        thing I could to make this book a success (starting with spending 3 years writing the best book possible), but the
        reception has outpaced even my high hopes. Highlights include: New York Times bestseller (#3 in Business and #5 in
        Advice/How-To) Wall Street Journal bestseller USA Today bestseller Audible bestseller Top 10 Most Sold on Amazon
        4.9/5 stars on Amazon (350+ reviews) 4.8/5 stars on Audible (2,250+ ratings) Featured on CBS This Morning (video)

        on Goodreads I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say “Thank You.” It means so much to me that you are finding
        the book useful and sharing it with others, and that my work is making some small difference in the world. If you're
        interested in buying a copy, click here to see the different options. Reach and Impact. It's hard to quantify, but
        I feel like my work is making a bigger impact this year than in previous years. Maybe it's just the excitement of
        seeing people read the book. Regardless, I have said from Day 1 that I want to optimize for reach over revenue. I
        don't care about making the most money. I just want to share the best ideas I can find with the greatest number of
        people. And this year we reached more people than ever before. Here's what the year looked like: 9 new articles published
        this year (browse my best articles) 241,827 new email subscribers this year 453,037 total email subscribers as of
        December 31, 2018 10,600,219 unique visitors this year 36,558,938 unique visitors since launching on November 12,
        2012 Despite the success, there are some downsides hidden within these numbers. I'll discuss them in the next section.
        Travel. After not visiting a new country in 2017, I decided I would make travel a priority in 2018. And holy moly,
        did I travel this year. My travel highlights for 2018 include: 7 countries (5 new): Argentina, Brazil, Chile, England,
        France, Japan, United States. 15 states (2 new): Arizona, California (4x), Florida (3x), Illinois (2x), Kansas, Massachusetts
        (2x), Nebraska, Nevada, New York (5x!), North Carolina (2x), Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington (2x). I continue
        to follow many of the strategies mentioned in my Ultralight Travel Guide, but I've also begun to implement some new
        approaches to accommodate for the number of speaking engagements I have do while traveling. I'll update that page
        soon. Rising to fame in the 1950s, she was one of the greatest actresses of her era. In 1953, Hepburn became the
        first actress to win an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single performance: her leading
        role in the romantic comedy Roman Holiday. Even today, over half a century later, she remains one of just 15 people
        to earn an “EGOT” by winning all four major entertainment awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. By the 1960s, she
        was averaging more than one new film per year and, by everyone's estimation, she was on a trajectory to be a movie
        star for decades to come. But then something funny happened: she stopped acting. Despite being in her 30s and at
        the height of her popularity, Hepburn basically stopped appearing in films after 1967. She would perform in television
        shows or movies just five times during the rest of her life. Instead, she switched careers. She spent the next 25
        years working tirelessly for UNICEF, the arm of the United Nations that provides food and healthcare to children
        in war-torn countries. She performed volunteer work throughout Africa, South America, and Asia. Hepburn's first act
        was on stage. Her next act was one of service. In December 1992, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom
        for her efforts, which is the highest civilian award of the United States. We will return to her story in a moment.
        This piece of code asks the username, and once the text is entered and the user presses enter, we send a greeting.
        The question() method shows the first parameter (a question) and waits for the user input. It calls the callback
        function once enter is pressed. In this callback function, we close the readline interface. readline offers several
        other methods, and I’ll let you check them out on the package documentation I linked above. If you need to require
        a password, it’s best to now echo it back, but instead showing a * symbol. The simplest way is to use the readline-sync
        package which is very similar in terms of the API and handles this out of the box. A more complete and abstract solution
        is provided by the Inquirer.js package. You can install it using npm install inquirer, and then you can replicate
        the above code like this: The labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate. There are no good habits
        or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some
        way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. When completing your Habits Scorecard, however, you can categorize
        your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run. Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive
        outcomes. Bad habits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s
        serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior. If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a
