    <h1>Trump's shutdown nightmare: A choice between the economy and the wall</h1>

    <p id="1">
        <pre>
                    (CNN)If the government shutdown lasts much longer, President Donald Trump's only way out may involve a choice between two pillars of his political viability -- his border wall and his purring economy.
                    More and more Americans are feeling the effects of the partial shutdown every day, from travelers stuck in security lines to Coast Guard officers now joining the hundreds of thousands of federal employees going without pay.
                    Yet the normal political pressure points that usually end shutdown standoffs are not working, perhaps because of the unique dynamics of the Trump era. As a result, there's every chance that the stalemate now in its 27th day could drag on much longer.
                    
                    Trump told supporters on Tuesday, for example, "We're going to stay out for a long time if we have to."
                    Sen. John Kennedy, who flew on Air Force One with the President on Monday, said Trump is adamant that he's not budging.
                    "He is a carnivore -- and on this one he believes he is right," the Louisiana Republican said. 

                    In another sign the impasse could be extended, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked the President to move the day of the State of the Union address -- now set for January 29 -- or deliver it in writing because of overstretched security agencies. A White House official familiar with preparations told CNN's Jim Acosta Wednesday night that, "at this point," Trump still plans to deliver the speech as scheduled on January 29.

                Shutdowns usually end when either side, the President or Congress, begins to feel unbearable pressure and the cost of going on outweighs the political damage sustained by a climbdown.
                Since that pivot point is not yet at hand, longer-term factors may come into play. One significant pressure point could be the side effects of the shutdown on economic growth, unemployment and consumer confidence.

                If the standoff over the President's demand that Democrats provide $5.7 billion in wall funding is prolonged, the chances of genuine damage to the economy -- one of the unarguable hot spots of Trump's presidency -- rise significantly. 
                Kevin Hassett, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has warned that the impact of the shutdown on government contractors is higher than expected and could significantly shave growth figures.

                White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders tried Wednesday to squash a growing narrative that the shutdown could put a dent in the Trump economy.
                "We are focused on the long-term economic goals of the administration," Sanders said. "We have an incredibly strong economy, thanks to the President. We look forward to reopening the government, continuing to build on what we've done the last two years."
                An economic headache could prove to be one way Trump begins to feel political heat over the shutdown, especially if it starts to reverberate in the stock markets, which have steadied after a volatile period at the turn of the year.
                But if the economy tempts him to cave, it will be a difficult choice, since the shutdown may be the last best chance to get funding for the wall during his term. While he could vow to continue the fight for the border wall in his re-election race, his promises could be devalued if he is defeated by Democrats this time around.
                So far, the President has not seemed to be moved by the traditional leverage points that occur during shutdowns.

                He's not showed much sympathy for government workers forced to go without pay, even suggesting that they want him to stand firm and get his wall.
                And since he's not made much effort to broaden his political coalition in office, he has few middle-of-the-road voters to lose from digging into a showdown that pleases his base.
                Democratic leaders are trying to change the equation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday invoked the plight of a government worker who missed a paycheck last week and is uncertain he can afford medicines.
                "I want President Trump to look into these faces and see what he is doing by using these men and women as pawns, using them in an extortion game," the New York Democrat said.
                "Mr. President, President Trump, look at the pain and suffering you're causing," Schumer said.

                But Trump has so far proven impervious to such appeals. A President who has always had a strong connection with the people who sent him to the White House is calculating he still has some breathing room.
