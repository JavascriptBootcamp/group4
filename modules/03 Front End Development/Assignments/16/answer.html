           Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
           With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[4]

           Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
           HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
                
           HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
           With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
           HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
           HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. 
           Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
           Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
                
           HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. 
           Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. 
           The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[5]</p><br/>

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
                
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
                
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
                
                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]
                
                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p><br/>

                JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
                It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[9] 
                JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. 
                The vast majority of websites use it,[10] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
                
                As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. 
                It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
                
                Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
                
                Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design; JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.[11]</p><br/>

                Git (/ɡɪt/[7]) is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily[citation needed] used for source-code management in software development,[8] but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision-control system, it is aimed at speed,[9] data integrity,[10] and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.[11]
                
                Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[12] Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano.
                
                As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[13]
                
                Git is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.</p><br/>
