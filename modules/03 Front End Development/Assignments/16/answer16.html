        <h1 id="anchor_definition">Definition and use of the term</h1>
        The term has no official definition by regulatory authorities in major consumer markets, such as the United States Food and
        Drug Administration and Department of Agriculture or the European Food Safety Authority.[5] It appears to have been
        first used in a Canadian newspaper in 1949 when referring to the supposed nutritional qualities of a muffin. [2]:68
        In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the term "superfood" was used as a marketing tool for selling specific
        foods, dietary supplements, foods with selected food additives, and self-help books about fad diets, promising an
        enhancement to health. "Superfood" products were sold at a higher price than similar foods not marketed with the
        label.[2]:71-71[6] The purported health benefits and effects of foods described as superfoods are unsupported or
        disputed by scientific studies.[1] As of 2007, the marketing of products as superfoods was prohibited in the European
        Union unless accompanied by a specific authorized health claim supported by credible scientific research.[7] The
        ruling was a marketing guide issued to manufacturers to assure scientific proof or evidence why a food would be labeled
        as extra healthy or classified as a superfood.[7] The European Food Information Council stated that it was impractical
        for people to have a diet based only on superfoods when nutrients are provided readily from a diet based on a diversity
        of foods, especially a diet including fruits and vegetables.[1] According to Cancer Research UK, "the term 'superfood'
        is really just a marketing tool, with little scientific basis to it".[8] According to Catherine Collins, chief dietitian
        at St George's Hospital in London, usage of the term can be harmful. Collins has stated that "[t]he term 'superfoods'
        is at best meaningless and at worst harmful. There are so many wrong ideas about superfoods that I don't know where
        best to begin to dismantle the whole concept."[9] Cancer Research UK notes that although superfoods are often promoted
        as having the ability to prevent or cure diseases, including cancer, they caution, "you shouldn't rely on so-called
        'superfoods' to reduce the risk of cancer. They cannot substitute for a generally healthy and balanced diet".[8]
        Superfruits are a subset of superfoods as first used in 2004.[10][11][12] The designation of a fruit as a superfruit
        is entirely up to the product manufacturer, as the term is primarily used to create consumer demand. The term has
        no official definition by regulatory authorities in major consumer markets, such as the United States Food and Drug

        The Dutch food safety organization Voedingscentrum noted that the health claims marketers used to sell goji berry, hemp seed,
        chia seed, and wheatgrass were not scientifically proven.[15] The organization warned that people who consumed such
        foods in large quantities may develop an "impaired, one-sided diet".[15] Berries remain under research and do not
        have evidence of providing any health benefits different from other fresh fruits.[1][16][10] Specifically, blueberries
        are not especially nutrient dense (a superfood characteristic);[1] they have moderate content of only three essential
        nutrients: vitamin C, vitamin K, and manganese.[4] The Dutch food safety organization Voedingscentrum noted that

        In 2007, the superfoods category was forecast to become a billion dollar global industry by 2011,[17] with several thousand
        new superfruit products expected to enter the marketplace. According to Datamonitor, superfruit product launches
        grew at a rate of 67% (2007–2008), but underwent significant category erosion beginning in 2011, when introductions
        of food and nonfood products featuring pomegranate, açaí or goji declined by 56% (2011–2012 vs. 2009–2010).[10][17]
        More than a dozen industry publications on functional foods and beverages have referred to various exotic species
        as superfruits, with estimates for some 10,000 new product introductions in 2007–2008.[11][17] Relatively rare fruits
        originating from Oceania (noni), China (goji, seabuckthorn), Southeast Asia (mangosteen) or tropical South America
        (açaí) and unknown to American consumers were among the first wave of superfruits successfully used in product manufacturing
        from 2005 to 2010,[18] but their popularity declined from 2010 to 2013.[10] However, consumer interest in new products
        using pomegranate remained constant during that time.[10] The company Tahitian Noni began selling noni juice in 1996
        and achieved billions of dollars in sales during their first 10 years.[18] Earlier reports showed pomegranate-based
        products grew nearly 400% over 2005–2007 from new product launches, a gain that exceeded the previous 6 years.[19]
        Similarly, sales of XanGo, a multiple-fruit juice containing mangosteen juice, grew from $40 million in 2002 to $200
        million in 2005.[18] Manufacturers may use some fruits to enhance the flavor of food products in an attempt to mask
        other tastes or provide impressions of novelty and health.[10][20] Five thousand new products were introduced in
        2005 based on berries alone.[10][21] The superfruit category was one of the top 10 global trends in consumer products
        in 2008.[22] By 2013, however, innovation in superfruit products appeared to be in decline, with fewer new introductions
        to the category.[10] Over the years 2011 to 2015, however, the number of food or beverage products containing the
        words "superfood", "superfruit" or "supergrain" had doubled.[23] In 2007, the superfoods category was forecast to

        <h1 id="anchor_origin">The origin of the superfood</h1>
        The concept of the superfood is a popular one when it comes to food and health. The media is full of reports of ultra-healthy
        foods, from blueberries and beetroot to cocoa and salmon. These reports claim to reflect the latest scientific evidence,
        and assure us that eating these foods will give our bodies the health kick they need to stave off illness and aging.
        But is there any truth to such reports? The current attention on superfoods has likely been encouraged by a growing
        public interest in food and health, particularly in the developed world.1 While the use of the term has been recorded
        as far back as the beginning of the 20th century, it has only recently become popular in mainstream language.2 A
        simple internet search for the word, superfood, reveals close to 10 million results — predominantly from health and
        nutrition blogs, online newspapers and magazines, and providers of nutritional supplements. Despite its ubiquity
        in the media, however, there is no official or legal definition of a superfood. The Oxford English dictionary, for
        example, describes a superfood as “a nutrient-rich food considered to be especially beneficial for health and well-being”,
        while the Merriam-Webster dictionary omits any reference to health and defines it as “a super nutrient-dense food,
        loaded with vitamins, minerals, fibre, antioxidants, and/or phytonutrients”.3,4 Generally speaking, superfoods refer
        to foods — especially fruits and vegetables — whose nutrient content confers a health benefit above that of other
        foods.
