        The saga as published by Norstedts in a large-size illustrated version (1880). The Great Heathen Army is said to have been
        led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, to wreak revenge against King Ælla of Northumbria who had supposedly executed
        Ragnar in 865 by casting him into a pit full of snakes. [8] The Great Heathen Army was organized and led by the brothers
        Ivar the Boneless, Ubba, Halfdan, Björn Ironside, Hvitserk, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye. The first four are known
        historical figures.[9] Ivar the Boneless was the leader of the Great Heathen Army from 865 to 870, but he disappears
        from English historical accounts after 870. [10] The Anglo-Saxon chronicler Æthelweard records Ivar's death as 870.
        [11] Halfdan Ragnarsson became the leader of the Great Heathen Army in about 870 and he led it in an invasion of
        Wessex. [12] A great number of Viking warriors arrived from Scandinavia, as part of the Great Summer Army, led by
        King Bagsecg of Denmark, bolstering the ranks of Halfdan's army.[13] According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the
        Danes battled the West Saxons nine times, including the Battle of Ashdown on 8 January 871, where Bagsecg was killed.[14]
        Halfdan accepted a truce from the future Alfred the Great, newly crowned king of Wessex.[15] Halfdan succeeded Bagsecg
        as King of most of Denmark (Jutland and Wendland) in about 871. Bjorn Ironside became King of Sweden and Uppsala
        in about 865, (the same year his father Ragnar is said to have died). Bjorn had two sons, Refil and Erik Björnsson.
        His son Erik became the next king of Sweden, and was succeeded in turn by Erik the son of Refil. Sigurd Snake-in-the-eye
        became King of Zealand and the Danish Isles in about 871, and also succeeded his brother Halfdan as King of Denmark

        in about 871, and also succeeded his brother Halfdan as King of Denmark in about 877. The saga as published by Norstedts
        in a large-size illustrated version (1880). The Great Heathen Army is said to have been led by the sons of Ragnar
        Lodbrok, to wreak revenge against King Ælla of Northumbria who had supposedly executed Ragnar in 865 by casting him
        into a pit full of snakes. [8] The Great Heathen Army was organized and led by the brothers Ivar the Boneless, Ubba,
        Halfdan, Björn Ironside, Hvitserk, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye. The first four are known historical figures.[9] Ivar
        the Boneless was the leader of the Great Heathen Army from 865 to 870, but he disappears from English historical
        accounts after 870. [10] The Anglo-Saxon chronicler Æthelweard records Ivar's death as 870. [11] Halfdan Ragnarsson
        became the leader of the Great Heathen Army in about 870 and he led it in an invasion of Wessex. [12] A great number
        of Viking warriors arrived from Scandinavia, as part of the Great Summer Army, led by King Bagsecg of Denmark, bolstering
        the ranks of Halfdan's army.[13] According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Danes battled the West Saxons nine times,
        including the Battle of Ashdown on 8 January 871, where Bagsecg was killed.[14] Halfdan accepted a truce from the
        future Alfred the Great, newly crowned king of Wessex.[15] Halfdan succeeded Bagsecg as King of most of Denmark (Jutland
        and Wendland) in about 871. Bjorn Ironside became King of Sweden and Uppsala in about 865, (the same year his father
        Ragnar is said to have died). Bjorn had two sons, Refil and Erik Björnsson. His son Erik became the next king of
        Sweden, and was succeeded in turn by Erik the son of Refil. Sigurd Snake-in-the-eye became King of Zealand and the
        Danish Isles in about 871, and also succeeded his brother Halfdan as King of Denmark in about 877. The saga as published
