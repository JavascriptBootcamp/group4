    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
        Pizza Hut was founded in June 1958 by two Wichita State University students, brothers Dan and Frank Carney, as
        a single location in Wichita, Kansas.[4] Six months later they opened a second outlet and within a year they
        had six Pizza Hut restaurants. The brothers began franchising in 1959. The iconic Pizza Hut building style was
        designed in 1963.[5] PepsiCo acquired Pizza Hut in November 1977.[6][7]

        Before closing in 2015, the oldest continuously operating Pizza Hut was in Manhattan, Kansas, in a shopping and
        tavern district known as Aggieville near Kansas State University. The first Pizza Hut restaurant east of the
        Mississippi River opened in Athens, Ohio, in 1966 by Lawrence Berberick and Gary Meyers.

    <h1>Concept</h1>
    <p>
        Pizza Hut is split into several different restaurant formats: the original family-style dine-in locations,;
        storefront delivery and carry-out locations, and hybrid locations that have carry-out, delivery, and dine-in
        options. Some full-sized Pizza Hut locations have a lunch buffet, with "all-you-can-eat" pizza, salad,
        desserts, and bread sticks, and a pasta bar. Pizza Hut has other business concepts independent of the store
        type.
