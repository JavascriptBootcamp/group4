            <p id="staff">A restaurant's proprietor is called a restaurateur, this derives from the French verb
                restaurer, meaning
                "to restore". Professional cooks are called chefs, with there being various finer distinctions (e.g.
                sous-chef, chef de partie). Most restaurants (other than fast food restaurants and cafeterias) will
                have various waiting staff to serve food, beverages and alcoholic drinks, including busboys who remove
                used dishes and cutlery. In finer restaurants, this may include a host or hostess, a maître d'hôtel to
                welcome customers and to seat them, and a sommelier or wine waiter to help patrons select wines. A new
                route to becoming a restauranter, rather than working one's way up through the stages, is to operate a
                food truck. Once a sufficient following has been obtained, a permanent restaurant site can be opened.
                This trend has become common in the UK and the US.

                used dishes and cutlery. In finer restaurants, this may include a host or hostess, a maître d'hôtel to
                welcome customers and to seat them, and a sommelier or wine waiter to help patrons select wines. A new
                route to becoming a restauranter, rather than working one's way up through the stages, is to operate a
                food truck. Once a sufficient following has been obtained, a permanent restaurant site can be opened.

                "Chef's table" redirects here. For the Netflix documentary series, see Chef's Table.

                The chef's table at Marcus restaurant,[3] in Knightsbridge
                A chef's table is a table located in the kitchen of a restaurant,[4][5] reserved for VIPs and special
                guests.[6] Patrons may be served a themed[6] tasting menu prepared and served by the head chef.
                Restaurants can require a minimum party[7] and charge a higher flat fee.[8] Because of the demand on
                the kitchen's facilities, chef's tables are generally only available during off-peak times.[9</p>
            <p id="Guides">Restaurant guides review restaurants, often ranking them or providing information to guide
                consumers
                (type of food, handicap accessibility, facilities, etc.). One of the most famous contemporary guides is
                the Michelin series of guides which accord from 1 to 3 stars to restaurants they perceive to be of high
                culinary merit. Restaurants with stars in the Michelin guide are formal, expensive establishments; in
                general the more stars awarded, the higher the prices.

                The main competitor to the Michelin guide in Europe is the guidebook series published by Gault Millau.
                Unlike the Michelin guide which takes the restaurant décor and service into consideration with its
                rating, Gault Millau only judges the quality of the food. Its ratings are on a scale of 1 to 20, with
                20 being the highest.

                lists.[27]
                In the United States, the Forbes Travel Guide (previously the Mobil travel guides) and the AAA rate
                restaurants on a similar 1 to 5 star (Forbes) or diamond (AAA) scale. Three, four, and five
                star/diamond ratings are roughly equivalent to the Michelin one, two, and three star ratings while one
                and two star ratings typically indicate more casual places to eat. In 2005, Michelin released a New
                York City guide, its first for the United States. The popular Zagat Survey compiles individuals'
                comments about restaurants but does not pass an "official" critical assessment. FreshNYC recommends
                plausible New York City restaurants for busy New Yorkers and visitors alike.[28]

                The Good Food Guide, published by the Fairfax Newspaper Group in Australia,[29] is the Australian guide
                listing the best places to eat. Chefs Hats are awarded for outstanding restaurants and range from one
                hat through three hats. The Good Food Guide also incorporates guides to bars, cafes and providers. The
                Good Restaurant Guide is another Australian restaurant guide that has reviews on the restaurants as
                experienced by the public and provides information on locations and contact details. Any member of the
                public can submit a review.

                Nearly all major American newspapers employ food critics and publish online dining guides for the
                cities they serve. Some news sources provide customary reviews of restaurants, while others may provide
                more of a general listings service.

                More recently Internet sites have started up that publish both food critic reviews and popular reviews
                by the general public.</p>
            <p id="Economics">Many restaurants are small businesses, and franchise restaurants are common. There is
                often a relatively
                large immigrant representation, reflecting both the relatively low start-up costs of the industry (thus
                making restaurant ownership an option for immigrants with relatively few resources) and the cultural
                importance of food.

                Canada
                There are 86,915 commercial foodservice units in Canada, or 26.4 units per 10,000 Canadians. By
                segment, there are:[30]

                38,797 full-service restaurants
                34,629 limited-service restaurants
                741 contract and social caterers
                6,749 drinking places
                Fully 63% of restaurants in Canada are independent brands. Chain restaurants account for the remaining
                37%, and many of these are locally owned and operated franchises.[31]

                Workers in the kitchen at Delmonico's Restaurant, New York, 1902.
                As of 2006, there are approximately 215,000 full-service restaurants in the United States, accounting
                for $298 billion in sales, and approximately 250,000 limited-service (fast food) restaurants,
                accounting for $260 billion.[33] Starting in 2016, Americans spent more on restaurants than
                groceries.[34]

                In October 2017, The New York Times reported there are 620,000 eating and drinking places in the United
                States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They also reported that the number of restaurants
                are growing almost twice as fast as the population.[35]

                One study of new restaurants in Cleveland, Ohio found that 1 in 4 changed ownership or went out of
                business after one year, and 6 out of 10 did so after three years. (Not all changes in ownership are
                indicative of financial failure.)[36] The three-year failure rate for franchises was nearly the
                same.[37]

                Restaurants employed 912,100 cooks in 2013, earning an average $9.83 per hour.[38] The waiting staff
                numbered 4,438,100 in 2012, earning an average $8.84 per hour.[39]

                Jiaxi Lu of the Washington Post reports in 2014 that, "Americans are spending $683.4 billion a year
                dining out, and they are also demanding better food quality and greater variety from restaurants to
                make sure their money is well spent."[40]

                Dining in restaurants has become increasingly popular, with the proportion of meals consumed outside
                the home in restaurants or institutions rising from 25% in 1950 to 46% in 1990. This is caused by
                factors such as the growing numbers of older people, who are often unable or unwilling to cook their
                meals at home and the growing number of single-parent households. It is also caused by the convenience
                that restaurants can afford people; the growth of restaurant popularity is also correlated with the
                growing length of the work day in the US, as well as the growing number of single parent
                households.[41] Eating in restaurants has also become more popular with the growth of higher income
                households. At the same time, less expensive establishments such as fast food establishments can be
                quite inexpensive, making restaurant eating accessible to many.

                Employment
                The restaurant industry in the United States is large and quickly growing, with 10 million workers. 1
                in every 12 U.S. residents work in the business, and during the 2008 recession, the industry was an
                anomaly in that it continued to grow. Restaurants are known for having low wages, which they claim are
                due to thin profit margins of 4-5%. For comparison, however, Walmart has a 1% profit margin.[42]

                As a result of these low wages, restaurant employees suffer from three times the poverty rate as other
                U.S. workers, and use food stamps twice as much.[42]

                Restaurants also employ marginalized groups. They are the largest employer of people of color.
                Restaurants rank as the second largest employer of immigrants. These workers statistically are
                concentrated in the lowest paying positions in the restaurant industry. In the restaurant industry, 39%
                of workers earn minimum wage or lower.[42]</p>
