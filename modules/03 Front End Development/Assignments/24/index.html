            The Sopranos is an American crime drama television series created by David Chase. The story revolves around
            Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), a New Jersey-based Italian-American mobster, and portrays the difficulties
            that he faces as he tries to balance his family life with his role as the leader of a criminal
            organization. These are explored during his therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine
            Bracco). The series features Tony's family members, mafia colleagues, and rivals in prominent roles—most
            notably his wife, Carmela (Edie Falco), and his protégé/distant cousin, Christopher Moltisanti (Michael
            Imperioli).
