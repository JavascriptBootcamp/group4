            <h3>What is an Old Garden Rose? To history it is a rose being of a class in existence before the year 1867. <br>
                Why 1867? Simple. This is the year a rose named “La France” was introduced. La France is considered to the be the first Hybrid Tea.
                <br> It is the offspring of the Hybrid Perpetual “Madame Victor Verdier” with the Tea rose “Madame Bravy”.<br>
                 The hybridizer was Guillot and what marked La France as being different from other roses was the high centered blossom we associate with Hybrid Teas of today. <br>
                 The name Hybrid Tea in fact comes from a wedding of the classes of the parents of La France. A Hybrid Perpetual and a Tea rose.

                Modern Roses are those varieties bred after 1867. Most people imagine these types when they think of
                roses. <br>
                Classification of Modern Roses can be complicated because many have Old Garden Roses in their ancestry,
                but they are largely classified by growth and flowering characteristics. Unlike Old Garden Roses which
                bloom once a year, Modern Roses bloom continuously.
                <br>They also have a larger bloom size and longer vase life, but lack fragrance, and are less hardy and
                disease resistant.
