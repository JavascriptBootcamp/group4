<p>Use <code>group4/Modules/03 Front End Development/Assignments/31</code></p>
<p>display each section ("Enter keywords or item number", "Search including", "Price" etc.) as a collapsed view.</p>
<p>the collapsed view should contain only the title (without the content).</p>
<p>clicking on the title should open the section content. <a href="https://master-origin-collapsible.fgview.com/demo/index.html#basic" target="_blank">example (do not use the code - only watch how it gets displayed)</a>.</p>
<p>add an "Expand All" button which allows expanding all sections at once.</p>
<p>clicking the "Expand All" button should change its text to "Collapse All" and then clicking on it should do the opposite - collapses all sections.</p>
<p>after collapsing the button should return to its initial state ("Expand All").</p>
<p>Illustration: (all sections are collapsed except from "Sellers" wchich is expanded)</p>
