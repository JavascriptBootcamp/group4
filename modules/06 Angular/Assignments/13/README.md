<p>submitting the quiz should hide the questions and display the amount of correct answers.</p>
<p>use a "question component". add 10 such components to <code>app.component.ts</code>.</p>
<h3>Recommendation for a solution:</h3>
<p>create models for questions and answers.</p>
<p>store the questions and the answers in a service. add the following functions to the service:
<ol>
<li>get all questions and answers</li>
<li>return whether an answer is correct or not</li>
<li>return how many answers are correct</li>
</ol>
use the service in order to check the user's answers and display the amount of correct answers.
